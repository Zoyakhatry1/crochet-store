3. **Update WhatsApp Number:**

   ```javascript
   const whatsappNumber = '919876543210'; // Replace with actual number
   ```
   Replace with your mom's WhatsApp number (with country code 91, no spaces or +)

4. **Change Admin Password (IMPORTANT!):**
   Open `app/admin/page.jsx` and find line ~13:

   ```

2. Enter password
3. You're in! 🎉

### Adding a New Product
1. Click "Add New Product" button
2. Fill in:
   - **Product Name**: e.g., "Cozy Baby Blanket"
   - **Price**: e.g., 1200
   - **Description**: Detailed description
   - **Emoji**: Choose from dropdown (🎁, 👶, 🧸, etc.)
   - **Badge**: Optional (New, Popular, Sale, Limited)
   - **Image URL**: Optional - leave empty to use emoji
3. Click "Add Product"
4. Product appears on store immediately!

### Editing a Product
1. Find the product in the list
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Update any fields
4. Click "Update Product"

### Deleting a Product
1. Find the product
2. Click "Delete" button
3. Confirm deletion

### Adding Product Images
**Option 1: Upload to public folder**
1. Add image to `public/images/` folder
2. In admin panel, enter: `/images/your-image.jpg`

**Option 2: Use online URL**
1. Upload image to Imgur, Cloudinary, or Google Drive (public)
2. Copy the direct image URL
3. Paste in the Image URL field

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Change the default password** in `app/admin/page.jsx`
2. **Don't share admin password** with customers
3. **Logout when done** managing products
4. The password is stored in browser - clear it by logging out

## 💾 Data Storage

Products are stored in **browser localStorage**, which means:
- ✅ No database setup needed
- ✅ Changes persist across sessions
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ⚠️ Data is browser-specific (if you clear browser data, products reset to defaults)
- ⚠️ Not shared across different devices/browsers

**For production**: Products sync across all visitors' browsers once set, but admin changes are made from one browser.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Free & Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Live in ~2 minutes!

3. **Access Admin:**
   - Your admin panel will be at: `yoursite.vercel.app/admin`
   - Products update in real-time for all visitors

## 📱 WhatsApp Message Format

When customer places order, WhatsApp message includes:
- Customer name, phone, address
- List of items with quantities and prices
- Total amount
- Request for UPI payment details

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Product Management
1. **Add products regularly** to keep store fresh
2. **Use clear descriptions** - customers can't touch the product
3. **Mark bestsellers** with "Popular" badge
4. **Use "New" badge** for recently added items
5. **Take good photos** - they sell better than emojis

### For Sales
1. **Respond quickly** to WhatsApp orders
2. **Send clear UPI QR codes**
3. **Confirm orders** promptly
4. **Track orders** in a spreadsheet
5. **Ask for reviews** from happy customers

A: You'll need to update it in the code (`app/admin/page.jsx`) and redeploy.

**Q: Will products disappear if she clears browser?**
A: On the same device, products persist. But for safety, you can add database later.
